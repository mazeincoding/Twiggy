# Twiggy Configuration
# 
# Twiggy generates real-time directory structure for Cursor AI
# Your AI always knows your codebase's structure automatically
# https://github.com/twiggy-tools/Twiggy
#
# This file controls what folders and files Twiggy ignores when generating directory structure
# Note: The generated .cursor/rules/file-structure.mdc is not tracked in git by design

# Custom folders/files to ignore (add your own here)
# You can use folder names or full paths:
#   - temp                    # ignores any folder named "temp"
#   - src/old-stuff          # ignores only "old-stuff" inside "src"
#   - docs/legacy/backup     # ignores specific deep path
ignore:
{ignore_list}

# Sync with .gitignore - automatically ignore anything in your .gitignore
syncWithGitignore: {sync_gitignore}
